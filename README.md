### Tools
- Excel
- Power BI

### Data Cleaning
  Power query editor was used for removing duplicates columns,change of data type

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Question 1.
What can you learn from the highest rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences have an effect on
ratings?
Question 2.
What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample?
Question 3.
Are there any demand & supply gaps that you can exploit in the market?
Question 4.
If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for?

### Data Analysis
use of DAX function to perform Calculations
Data modelling to find relationships betwween columns and carry out merge/append tables when necessary

### Limitation
There is bais in data sampling or data collection as all population were not fully repesented, perhaps data was collected in a school area. majority of the respondents were young people and just a handful were from the elderly population.

### Results
Top rated restaurants were mostly located in a closed area and most restaurants did not allow alcohol.
These two factors may have affected overall rating. Customers preferences on cuisine did not necessarily
have effect on ratings as the highest rated restaurants did not offer Mexican cuisines. the highest rated
restaurants was Tortas Locas Hippocampo and the cuisine it offered was fast food. ordinarily restaurants with Mexican offering Mexican food should be rated high but this this was not the case.

Most customers were single and unemployed and the average age of the customers was 27. this
indicates a bias in the data sample as other population were not fully represented.

The most preferred cuisines were Mexican cuisines. smaller restaurants can exploit this by providing
Mexican dishes.

If I were to invest in a restaurant, that restaurant should provide Mexican cuisine since the restaurants is
located in Mexico, as this will increase customer patronage. Also, cuisines provided should be
affordable. and it should not allow alcohol and should be in a close area, as customers may prefer
privacy
